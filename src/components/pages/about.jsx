            In Informatics, dummy data is benign information that does not
            contain any useful data, but serves to reserve space where real data
            is nominally present. ... For testing, dummy data can also be used
            as stubs or pad to avoid software testing issues by ensuring that
            all variables and data fields are occupied.
